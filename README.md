Running:
To run the application, open in xCode, and run the simulator.
This app uses IOS 9.1 and has been tested in the iPhone 6s simulator.

Data:
For a quicker way of populating the data, use the import feature and this address which a json file can be found:

Unfortunately, tags cannot be interpreted from json files, so add these after import.
